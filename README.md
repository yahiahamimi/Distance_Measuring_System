# Simple Distance Measuring system

This project is a simple implementation of an Ultrasonic sensor using an ATmega32 microcontroller. The sensor is connected to the microcontroller via the ICP1 pin (input capture pin) and the microcontroller generates an interrupt whenever the sensor detects an obstacle. 
The distance of the obstacle is then calculated and displayed on an LCD screen.
